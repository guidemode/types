/**
 * AIVA Enablement Framework
 *
 * Defines the 6-pillar × 4-work-stream enablement model for AI across the SDLC
 * (24 work streams; count them from AIVA_ENABLEMENT_WORK_STREAM_KEYS, never by hand).
 * This is a framework-locked design — pillars and work streams are not user-editable.
 *
 * Two distinct AI modes in development:
 * - AI Agentic Coding: Human + AI in terminal/IDE (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor)
 * - AI Workflow Agents: Autonomous AI in tools (GitHub, Jira, CI) responding to signals

      "Engineers operate as orchestrators — spending the majority of time on problem definition, context engineering, and verification strategy rather than raw implementation. TDD is mandatory in agentic workflows: write tests first, have the agent generate minimum code to pass them, constraining drift. Context engineering (curating what the agent sees via CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, and structured project instructions) is the single biggest determinant of output quality, and cognitive debt (the gap between code that exists and the team's understanding of it) is actively managed.",

Authentication, logging, configuration, observability, and error handling are solved once as shared libraries, so teams spend time on business logic rather than reinventing infrastructure. Service scaffolds come pre-wired with these modules, CI pipelines, and security policies — new services are production-ready from the first commit.',

Verification checklists are mandatory: does the code match the stated intent, are edge cases handled, is the code comprehensible to the team? AI-assisted reviewers run in CI providing first-pass feedback, but human reviewers focus on architectural fit, business logic correctness, and trade-off decisions.',

Talent strategy adapts to attract and retain engineers who thrive in AI-augmented environments.',

These are embedded automations operating inside the engineering toolchain, not chatbots.',

The "Rule of Two" provides a practical heuristic: an AI agent can safely do at most two of three things — process untrusted inputs, access sensitive data, or change state. If all three are needed, human-in-the-loop approval is mandatory.',

The acceleration of code generation through AI demands proportionally increased security vigilance — more code surface area means more attack surface.',
